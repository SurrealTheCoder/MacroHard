This is a general repository to track and add new changes to a website I'm building for a class project with 4 other people. This github will be changed daily with new content and such.

This repository is also open to any outside help, because I could seriously use it. I'm currently the only person developing this site, and all these changes have been made over the past 2 days. I'm planning on rewriting the product.js and cart.html files to deal with a certain null error at the function at line 92 of my JS file. kind of annoying really.
