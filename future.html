     <p class="goal">Well, that's a decently hard question to answer if we're totally honest. But, first, we're planning
         on a 200% net revenue increase by the end of 2020 compared to 2019, which had about a 120% increase over 2018.
         because of this history of revenue growth, we expect to have about a 135% growth in revenue by the end of 2021
         compared to 2020. 
     </p>
     <p class="goal">Due to this revenue growth over the next few years, we are also expecting a large employee increase around 
         the late 2nd quarter of 2021 after our quarterly reports. This should be exciting for our customers as well, as this means
         more job openings, company growth, and even higher quality products for the prices given.
